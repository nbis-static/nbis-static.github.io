This is by far the cleanest\narchitecture for studying general low-level hardware and operating\nsystem implementation details.\n\n### History\nI wanted to understand how the amazing [JsLinux][1] worked, so in a\nfit of mania I hand de-obfuscated the codebase while studying it over\na few days' time.  In the off-chance someone else might be interested\nin this code as a basis for further weird in-browser x86 hacking I\nposted this redacted version of the code here, with permission of\nMr. Bellard.\n\n### Status\n\nThe current codebase should run on most modern versions of Chrome,\nSafari, and Firefox.  If you're running it locally, you will need to\nload it via a local server to allow the XHR requests to load the\nbinaries.\n\njslinux-deobfuscated is still a dense, messy code base from any\npedagogic point of view.  However for those interested in\nMr. Bellard's code, this version is nowhere near so incomprehensible\nas the original.  Nearly all of the global variables and function\nnames have been named somewhat sensibly.  Many pointers to references\nhave been added to the source.\n\nThe core opcode execution loop has been commented to indicate what\ninstruction the opcode refers to.\n\n### Unresolved\n\nOne mystery is, why does CPUID(1) return 8 << 8 in EBX? EBX[15:8] is\nnow used to indicate CLFLUSH line size, but that field must have been\nused for something else in the past.\n\nThe CALL\/RET\/INT\/IRET routines are still quite confused and haven't\nyet been rewritten.  The code dealing with segmentation, and some of\nthe code for real-mode remains relatively messy.\n\nAny recommendations \/ clarifications are welcome!\n\n### ETC\n\nI highly recommend, by the way, the excellent [JSShaper][2] library\nfor transforming large javascript code bases.  The hacks I made from\nit are in this repo: a little symbol-name-transformer node.js script\nand an emacs function for doing this in live buffers.\n\n### License\n\nThis is a pedagogical\/aesthetic derivative of the original JSLinux\ncode Copyright (c) 2011-2014 Fabrice Bellard.

The Training events aims towards PhD students, postdocs, investigators and other researchers within all Swedish universities. The Training events are national and have a small fee for the participants.\n\nThe educational activities cover knowledge and understanding regarding a wide range within the Bioinformatics field. We offer both introductory level activities as well as niched and advanced level activities within specialized research and\/or technology areas. You can by attending our Training activities learn how to benefit from NBIS Bioinformatics expert resources and skills, how to plan your projects and how to analyse your data. The NBIS Training events are usually shorter than other educational activities and more focused on a single subject.\n\nIn addition to the more classical Training activities, NBIS offers PhD students the chance to take part of the [Swedish Bioinformatics Advisory Program](<https:\/\/www.scilifelab.se\/training\/the-swedish-bioinformatics-advisory-program>). This is a mentorship program where the PhD students get the unique opportunity to get a senior Bioinformatician from NBIS\/SciLifeLab as a personal advisor for up to two years of their PhD studies. This call that runs yearly is a competitive call.\n\nNBIS is also involved in the SciLifeLab Bioinformatics and Genomics Seminar Series \u2013 BiG Talks! \u2013 that is a live broadcasted event via the [SciLifeLab Youtube channel](<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCfWQHAK8UW0mPghV8R-Jqzg>) that aims to create networking possibilities for the SciLifeLab community and Bionformaticians and Genomics interested researchers and Staff scientists across the SciLifeLab nodes in Sweden. The BiG Talks! seminar series is to be given 4 times per year at different SciLifeLab nodes across Sweden. Please check the NBIS event page or the SciLifeLab website for current information.\n\nNBIS is offering Tailor-made training events \u2013 courses\/workshops that are tailored to your specific needs and audience. For instance, we can offer hands-on training assistance in a number of focused research areas (please see our staff pages or contact us for further details). We could in discussions with you set-up a curriculum covering your chosen group of participants need and provide expert Bioinformaticians as teacher for the event. The cost for such activities is the same as for Support (see <https:\/\/nbis.se\/support\/support.html> for updated fees), where the cost for planning, setting-up the event, travels and the event on site is included in the budget plan.\n\nPlease note that NBIS training events do not provide any formal university credits. The training content is estimated to correspond to a certain number of credits, however the estimated credits are just guidelines. If formal credits are crucial, the student needs to confer with the home department before submitting a course application in order to establish whether the course is valid for formal credits or not.\n\nFor any questions related to the NBIS Training activities, please contact [education@nbis.se](<mailto:education@nbis.se>) for inquiries.\n"},{"title":"Support - help with analyses","date":"2022-01-19T13:20:07+00:00","url":"\/support\/support\/support.html","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"    \n\n# Support - help with analyses\n\nWe offer support for SEK800 per hour. These hours are not tied to specific days\/weeks but can be spread out over several months if necessary. We only count time when our experts are actively working with your project (including meetings), compute-time is free. Support is only available if you already have data. If you are in the planning stage of your project or are waiting for data, we will instead offer a free consultation meeting.\n\nThe support we offer will be based on your needs. If you want to run the analyses yourself but need help to get started, we can give expert advice on best practices and suggest tools for you. We can be there as a discussion partner for your whole project if you like.\n\nWe can also do all the bioinformatic analyses for you. This is our most common type of support.\n\nWe have no application deadlines, projects are accepted continuously, and we strive to answer you within a working week. We make no scientific ranking of the projects we receive, and will only reject projects based on low feasibility or lack of available competence in NBIS.\n\nWhen you have registered your project in our support form (see link below), a coordinator will contact you to set up a first meeting with one of our experts. Once you have agreed with the expert to what analyses should be performed, a contract will be written. This contract needs to be printed out, signed by the PI of the project, and then submitted to NBIS. The NBIS coordinator and expert will be helping you in this process. Once this is done, the support can start. When the project is ongoing you will communicate with the expert via email and\/or meetings as necessary. The coordinator will also be available to support you if needed.\n\nPlease apply using the [NBIS Support Request Form](<\/support\/supportform\/index.php?form=support>).\n"},{"title":"Nbis support services","date":"2022-01-19T13:20:07+00:00","url":"\/support\/support","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"    \n\n# NBIS Support Services\n\nNBIS support services cover the full range of community needs, from short consultations to long-term engagement.\n\nN.B.: Our support services are also available for researchers at private companies, clinics and from abroad, but we are then required to charge for full cost coverage.\n\n## General support services\n\n**Bioinformatics drop-in sessions**\n     Weekly drop-in sessions in Lund, G\u00f6teborg, Link\u00f6ping, Stockholm, Uppsala and Ume\u00e5.  \n[Read more](<dropin.html>)\n**Consultation meetings (free)**\n     Study design consultation meetings with one of our experts.  \n[Read more](<consultation.html>) | [Apply](<\/support\/supportform\/index.php?form=consultation>)\n**Short- and Medium-term Support (user fee)**\n     This track is mainly targeting projects with a reasonably well-defined bioinformatics problem.

This track is intended for projects requiring NBIS support staff of at least 12 person months over the project life-time, running minimally 2 and maximally 5 years calendar time (eg. 0.5 FTE over 2 years). The NBIS staff have their workplace located together with other NBIS experts at NBIS hubs, but other arrangements can be decided if all involved parties agree. Projects interested to engage with NBIS as Partner Projects are welcome to contact us at any time to discuss the details and conditions for this support!\n\nPlease apply using the [NBIS Support Request Form](<\/support\/supportform\/index.php?form=partnerproject>).\n\n## Rules and guidelines\n\n### Agreement and costs\n\nNBIS partner projects are preferably discussed and agreed before a project applies for funding from a funding agency, with NBIS salary costs specified in the proposed budget (and possibly with NBIS as a co-applicant in the proposal, if applicable). NBIS will apply a standardised salary level and indirect cost model for the NBIS staff in the budget calculations, as specified in the [Partner Projects agreement template](<\/assets\/doc\/nbis-form-pp-ver3.pdf>). Additional costs (within reasonable limits) like travelling and personal computers for the NBIS staff are not charged to the project budget.\n\n### Involvement\n\nThe research group should assign at least one scientist from their group to take part in the bioinformatics work to ensure efficient knowledge transfer. Exceptions from this rule can be negotiated on a case-to-case basis, if particular reasons apply.\n\n### Feasibility\n\nNBIS will review the feasibility of the project before entering into a partner project, reviewing the project plan and the funding proposal, to ensure feasibility in terms of the study design, manpower and data management. In case a project wants to engage NBIS as a partner after a funding proposal has been submitted or granted, NBIS will review the project plan on the same grounds as above. NBIS will not engage in projects or project proposals not considered technically feasible, or if NBIS cannot provide the required competence for the project. NBIS will not review the scientific quality of the project, nor the ethical, legal and societal implications of the project, as this will be done by the funding agency.\n\n### Project management and budget revisions\n\nThe NBIS engagement in a partner project is specified in terms of manpower and calendar time according to the project budget and the project plan. As for any research collaboration, revisions of the budget and the project plan are discussed regularly. The lead PI of the project is the primary responsible for the project management, including the engaged NBIS staff. A status meeting with the main PI, the responsible NBIS manager and the NBIS staff is conducted every second month, or at any time needed.\n\n### Staff\n\nThe NBIS staff by default have their workplace located together with other NBIS experts at NBIS hubs. The NBIS staff assigned to the project can be either existing NBIS expert(s), or new recruitment(s) to NBIS, depending on the project needs and the available staff. The assigned NBIS staff working on the project should match the FTE (full-time equivalents) in the project budget, but can be distributed across NBIS experts with different expertise as most suitable to reach the project goals.\n\n### NBIS Partner Projects and other NBIS support tracks\n\nPartner projects can not utilize any other NBIS project support tracks during the timeframe of the project. Should substantially more resources than planned be needed, this should be solved by expanding the budget within the Partner Project. The partner project PI is most welcome to utilize other NBIS support tracks for other parallel research projects as usual.\n\n### Termination of the agreement\n\nIn case the funding is not granted, the research group is free to withdraw from the Partner Project agreement at no cost. In case the assigned NBIS expert(s) is no longer available, and no adequate replacement can be offered, the research group is free to withdraw from the partner project agreement at no cost, except for the NBIS salary already used (if any). For other terminations of the agreement, three (3) months notice is applied in both directions.\n\nProjects interested to engage with NBIS as Partner Projects are welcome to contact us at any time to discuss the details and conditions for this support!\n"},{"title":"Long-term support

Long-term Support offers extensive bioinformatics support to a limited set of scientifically outstanding projects. This support has been enabled primarily by a generous grant from [Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW)](<http:\/\/www.wallenberg.com\/kaw\/en>). The idea is simple: A senior bioinformatician will work in your project 500 hours for free! Hands-on involvement by the applying research group is strictly required to ensure efficient knowledge transfer.\n\nCurious about what we work on? Please see our [project list](<ltsprojects.html>).\n\n## The team\n\nThe Long-term Support team has internationally competitive expert knowledge in large-scale omics data analyses. The staff are experts in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenetics, metagenomics, metabolomics, single-cell analyses and multi-omics integration, and our joint experience spans across many types of organisms and include both medical, ecological and evolutionary research. The staff currently comprise 20+ advanced applied bioinformaticians, many who have also experience in developing novel bioinformatics tools and methods. The coding skills ranges from experienced scripting to full software development. All staff are devoted full-time to bioinformatics support, and are not driving their own research careers.\n\n## The support model\n\nThe framework of the support model is:\n\n  * Any research group at a Swedish university can apply for support. Applications are submitted in open calls three times per year (Jan\/May\/Oct), and are selected based on scientific peer-review by a national Proposals Evaluation Committee (PEC).\n  * Granted applications will be offered help with bioinformatics data analyses by experienced bioinformaticians for a maximum of 500h effective time. Extensions and multiple project applications are possible, but the same research group (PI) can only be granted a maximum of 1000h effective time over a period of two calendar years.\n  * At least one member of the research group must be assigned to work hands-on with the data analysis alongside the Long-term Support staff to ensure transfer of know-how.\n  * The support is free of charge.\n\n\n\nThe exact amount of time granted will be decided on a case-by-case basis. The Long-term Support staff will be fully integrated members of the research project during the time of the support, taking part in the scientific discussions and participating as co-authors of manuscripts according to normal contribution criteria. All work and analyses done will be fully available to the research group, including scripts and programs. Analysis tools and technical knowledge gain during the project will be made immediately public (ie before publication) unless otherwise agreed upon.\n\n## Application criteria\n\nSuccessful applications should fulfil the following main criteria\n\n**Scientific quality**\n     A scientific advisory board with national delegates will score the scientific quality of the project.\n**Feasibility**\n     The Long-term Support management will evaluate if the support team has the technical expertise needed to contribute to the project.\n**Involvement**\n     The applying party must assign at least one scientist from their group to take part in the bioinformatics work to ensure efficient knowledge transfer and longevity of the project beyond the time of the granted support.\n**Data availability**\n     For logistic reasons, priority will be given to projects with at least some of the data already delivered.\n\nIt is advantageous but not strictly required, that the scientist(s) assigned from the applicant\u2019s side have some experience in working in a Unix\/Linux environment and\/or has some previous experience in scripting. Previous knowledge in bioinformatics is not a factor in the evaluation process.\n\n## How to apply\n\nApplications can be submitted by filling out this form:\n\n<https:\/\/nbis.se\/support\/supportform\/index.php?form=longterm>\n\nApplications will be reviewed 3 times a year. Coming deadlines can be found at the application submission form above. Projects not granted support, or projects with previous support granted but in need of further assistance, are welcome to re-apply.\n\n## Questions\n\nFor further questions, please contact [bioinformatics_wabi@scilifelab.se](<mailto:bioinformatics_wabi@scilifelab.se>)\n"},{"title":"Working with human data","date":"2022-01-19T13:20:07+00:00","url":"\/support\/human-data","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"    \n\n# Working with human data\n\nNBIS support projects frequently concerns omics (and other) data derived from humans.

There are two sub-teams, one of which focuses on assembly and the other on annotation. The assembly team is specialized in assembling eukaryote genomes, with competence stretching all from quality control of raw reads to the final assembled and validated genome. The core competence of the annotation team lies in identifying and characterizing the structure and function of genes in a given genome.\n\nThe service in a few keywords:\n\n  * Project planning, general advice, or full responsibility for genome assembly and annotation projects\n  * High quality genome assemblies including extensive quality control of data and results\n  * Full-featured genome annotations with short turn-around and to a competitive, high standard.\n  * Hosting of web-based tools for visualization and curation of annotations\n  * Dedicated compute cluster for running complex annotation projects\n  * Experienced bioinformaticians with PhD degrees and several years of working experience in the fields of genome assembly and annotation\n\n\n\n## General information\n\nOur work generally starts with a detailed discussion between your group and one of our experienced bioinformaticians regarding the project and its goal. This is to ensure that we understand the aim of the research and what you want to use the results for. One of our experts will then be assigned to your project and be your main contact all throughout the support process. The level of interaction between the expert and the customer is very much up to the customer, i.e., you. You can be highly involved in the process if you want to, or just let go and let us deliver the final results to you.\n\nWe prefer being involved as early as possible in the project, preferably already at the planning stage. This way we know that data of the right type is ordered, and we can also remind you to order RNA-seq data for annotation. Early consultation is not counted towards the total number of hours used in the project, it is always completely free.\n\n## Genome assembly\n\nGenome assembly can be divided into three parts: Quality control, assembly, and assembly validation. Each of these parts is of vital importance for the final result, and all steps need to be run with an attention to detail. The aim at the end is to have an assembly that is as contiguous as possibly, but also as error-free as possible. In other words, you want long parts of the genome be assembled, but you also want it to be correct. We have pipelines setup to run all of these analyses, which in combination with our long experience of assembly will generate assemblies of the best possible quality.\n\nQuality control - General sequence quality is examined, but also level of duplication in the sequence reads as well as presence of adapters and contaminants. We also run k-mer analyses to get an estimate of the genome size and an idea of the complexity and information content of the read data. If there are serious problems with the data to the level that we cannot guarantee a good assembly, we halt the project and contact the customer to discuss what might have gone wrong and how to best proceed. Sometimes data need to be re-sequenced or additional data need to be ordered.\n\nAssembly - All assembly projects are different, which also means that no assembly program will be best for all projects. We run a number of assembly programs in parallel and send all results on to assembly validation.\n\nAssembly validation - Here assembly statistics are investigated and the assemblies are checked for misassemblies and other assembly artifacts. The results are compared and the assembly with the best balance between contiguity and number of assembly errors is chosen for annotation.\n\n## Genome annotation\n\nAn annotation project starts with an inventory of what data is already available, for example annotations from closely related organisms. We then perform quality checks on the data and generate the initial raw computes (mapping of all data onto the assembly). The raw compute stage typically includes protein sequences from related species (where available), modeled repeat sequences, non-coding RNA predictions using tRNAscan and co-variance models from the RNA family database Rfam, as well as reconstructed transcripts from your RNA-seq data.\n\nFrom the raw alignments, we will then compute a first test gene build. Normally, the pipeline that we use for this purpose is Maker2. Once a draft gene build has been generated, our experts will manually inspect its quality and determine the subsequent strategy required to achieve the best possible annotation result. Commonly, this entails the training of an ab-initio gene finder to further improve the detection of novel loci as well as a fine-tuning of the build parameters and input data.\n\nOnce completed, the next step is to rerun the pipeline on all data and scaffolds. The resulting candidate release will be uploaded to our genome portal for customer feedback and manual curation. Curation is generally performed together with the customer and often limited to regions of particular interest. It can however also be carried out on the entire genome, where requested.\n\nThe stable gene build will finally be subjected to functional annotation in order to identify putative biological roles, conserved domains and GO terms for subsequent analyses.\n\n## Getting support\n\nIf you are interested in getting support for your assembly- and\/or annotation-project, please open a support request using our [form](<\/support\/supportform\/index.php>).\n\nThis service is partly funded by user fees.

Sweden is together with 22 other European countries engaged in 1+MG since 2018.\n\nCurrently, the 1+MG project is doing a survey aiming to understand what existing genomic datasets and corresponding phenotypic\/clinical information are effectively available for participation in the 1+MG. It should also help to understand what are the challenges and bottlenecks for sharing, and how they may be overcome by development of technical or policy solutions. The answers will be analysed to make recommendations for the design of a European framework for sharing genomic and associated clinical data, develop solutions to overcome challenges, and also to provide guidance for participation in the 1+MG initiative.\n\nWe would therefore encourage all Swedish research groups with WGS\/WES data to complete the [survey](<https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/eusurvey\/runner\/1plusMG_Survey2020>) (even if you do not have ethical approval to share data), which is available on the European Commission\u2019s EU Survey platform: <https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/eusurvey\/runner\/1plusMG_Survey2020>.\n\nContact persons: Bengt Persson, NBIS, [bpn@icm.uu.se](<mailto:bpn@icm.uu.se>) Mikaela Friedman, GMS, [mikaela.friedman@ki.se](<mailto:mikaela.friedman@ki.se>)\n"},{"title":"B1mg-survey","date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","url":"\/news\/2020\/11\/26\/b1mg-survey","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]}},{"title":"[roadmap for the european 1 million genomes initiative](<> \"permalink for roadmap for the european 1 million genomes initiative\")","date":"2022-01-19T13:20:07+00:00","url":"\/news\/2020\/11\/26\/b1mg-roadmap\/b1mg-roadmap","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"    \n\nNovember 26, 2020\n\n[![](\/assets\/img\/logos\/icon-share-twitter.png)](<https:\/\/twitter.com\/share?url=https:\/\/nbis.se\/news\/2020\/11\/26\/b1mg-roadmap\/> \"Tweet it!\")\n\n###  [Roadmap for the European 1 million genomes initiative](<> \"Permalink for Roadmap for the European 1 million genomes initiative\")\n\nThe [roadmap](<\/assets\/doc\/1MillionGenomesRoadmap2020-2022.pdf>) for the implementation of the European 1+ Million Genomes Initiative is now available.

The project is a collaboration between SLU and SciLifeLab in Uppsala and Stockholm.\n\nThe project focus on genomics and forest genetics and builds on a previous grant from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation which resulted in the first ever mapping of a genome of a conifer tree, namely the Norway spruce. The current project is coordinated by Ove Nilsson at SLU and, as representative of SciLifeLab, Ulf Gyllensten at UU, and will be performed at SLU, Ume\u00e5 University and SciLifeLab Uppsala and Stockholm.\n\nThe aim of project is to generate a new, greatly improved, genome sequence for Norway spruce and, for the first time determine the genome of Scots pine. Subsequently, the genome for about individual 1000 trees will be studied in order to identify the genes that regulate growth rate and wood quality. This knowledge will be used in forest tree breeding to increase productivity. SciLifeLab is responsible for determining the forest trees genomes and performing bioinformatic analyzes of these data.\n\nNBIS is a crucial partner in the project and will provide a large part of the bioinformatics competence needed for the massive genome assembly and re-sequencing efforts of this project.\n\n#### [SciLifeLab press release](<https:\/\/www.scilifelab.se\/news\/scilifelab-forest-genetic-research\/?utm_campaign=nyhetsbrev&utm_medium=email&utm_source=apsis>)\n\n#### [News article from SLU](<https:\/\/www.slu.se\/en\/ew-news\/2019\/1\/slu-receives-major-grants-for-forest-research\/>)\n\n#### [Press release from The Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (in Swedish)](<https:\/\/kaw.wallenberg.org\/press\/knut-och-alice-wallenbergs-stiftelse-satsar-280-miljoner-kronor-pa-skogsforskning>)\n"},{"title":"Forestgeneticskaw","date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","url":"\/news\/2019\/01\/17\/forestgeneticskaw","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]}},{"title":"17","date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","url":"\/news\/2019\/01\/17","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]}},{"title":"[elixir sme forum in stockholm march 5-6 2019](<> \"permalink for elixir sme forum in stockholm march 5-6 2019\")","date":"2022-01-19T13:20:07+00:00","url":"\/news\/2019\/01\/16\/sme\/sme","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"    \n\nJanuary 16, 2019\n\n[![](\/assets\/img\/logos\/icon-share-twitter.png)](<https:\/\/twitter.com\/share?url=https:\/\/nbis.se\/news\/2019\/01\/16\/sme\/> \"Tweet it!\")\n\n###  [ELIXIR SME Forum in Stockholm March 5-6 2019](<> \"Permalink for ELIXIR SME Forum in Stockholm March 5-6 2019\")\n\n[![](\/assets\/img\/logos\/elixirsmeforum.png)](<https:\/\/www.elixir-europe.org\/industry\/forums>) The Swedish and Finnish ELIXIR nodes are co-organizing an **ELIXIR Innovation and SME Forum** with a focus on Genomics and Associated Data in National Healthcare Initiatives March 5\u20136 together with [Scilifelab](<https:\/\/www.scilifelab.se\/>) Stockholm.\n\nThe lunch-to-lunch event is free of charge, and open to researchers working in the personalised medicine sector, large and small companies that develop services for healthcare systems or are users of genomics and\/or associated data, as well as people involved in national healthcare initiatives and anyone else who is interested in learning more about data-driven innovation in the healthcare sector.\n\nIn addition to keynotes from [1928 Diagnostics](<https:\/\/1928diagnostics.com\/>), [BC Platforms](<https:\/\/www.bcplatforms.com\/>), [Genomics England](<https:\/\/www.genomicsengland.co.uk\/>) and [Illumina](<https:\/\/emea.illumina.com\/>), there will be presentations of [ELIXIR](<https:\/\/www.elixir-europe.org\/>), national genomics initiatives and a **flash talk session** where participating companies can present their activities.\n\nThe purpose of the [ELIXIR Innovation and SME Forums](<https:\/\/www.elixir-europe.org\/industry\/forums>) is to inform about ELIXIR resources, and to create a space to network for industry and academia.\n\n![](\/assets\/img\/brain-organic.svg)[More information and preliminary program](<https:\/\/www.elixir-europe.org\/events\/elixir-sme-forum-sweden>)\n\n[Registration](<https:\/\/sme_stockholm.eventbrite.co.uk\/>) **(Deadline: Fri 22 February 2019)**\n\n[ELIXIR Industry brochure](<https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B8in1NtGRloYYVRDT1J2QUhhN00\/view>)\n\n## Welcome!\n\n![](\/assets\/img\/logos\/ELIXIR_logo.png)\n"},{"title":"Sme","date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","url":"\/news\/2019\/01\/16\/sme","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]}},{"title":"16","date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","url":"\/news\/2019\/01\/16","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]}},{"title":"[apply now: bioinformatics long-term support](<> \"permalink for apply now: bioinformatics long-term support\")","date":"2022-01-19T13:20:07+00:00","url":"\/news\/2019\/01\/10\/lts\/lts","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"    \n\nJanuary 10, 2019\n\n[![](\/assets\/img\/logos\/icon-share-twitter.png)](<https:\/\/twitter.com\/share?url=https:\/\/nbis.se\/news\/2019\/01\/10\/lts\/> \"Tweet it!\")\n\n###  [Apply now: Bioinformatics Long-term Support](<> \"Permalink for Apply now: Bioinformatics Long-term Support\")\n\nOne of the national services offered by NBIS is [Bioinformatics Long-term support](<\/support\/longtermsupport.html>) (a.k.a.

The results are based on whole genome DNA sequencing of 1 000 individuals, selected to cover the variation in the whole country. Thanks to this Sweden now has a national resource, which will facilitate research and diagnostics of genetic diseases. The information has today been made available for researchers in health care and life science, and constitutes a big step forward for genetic research globally. \n\n\u201dThis map will have great impact on many international research projects which investigate the connection between genetic variants and diseases.\u201d Says Ulf Gyllensten at Uppsala University\/SciLifeLab who leads the project.\n\nThe resource will also be directly useful for the health care sector to investigate if a genetic change in the patient is the probable cause of disease or if the variant is also present in healthy individuals.\n\n\u201cDiagnostics of inherited diseases have taken a leap forward thanks to the new methods for analysis of our genome.\u201d Says Anna Wedell, at Karolinska Institutet who is also senior physician at Karolinska University Hospital.\n\n\u201dInterpretation of data from a patient\u2019s genome is facilitated the more we know about normal genetic variation. With this map our ability to help the patients increases even further\u201d. Says Anna Wedell.\n\nMany groups at SciLifeLab have been involved in the sequencing of the DNA-samples and the method development for data analysis. These are huge datasets and around 100 000 gigabyte of sequencing data has been produced. Since human DNA sequences contain sensitive and personally identifiable information there have been great efforts put into protecting privacy and data security.\n\n\u201dThe fantastic thing about this resource is that it is available for all researchers. This is possible since no information about single individuals are given out, only how frequently occurring a certain gene variant is within the group.\u201d Says Adam Ameur, at Uppsala University, who works as bioinformatician in the project.\n\nThis map represents an important progress, but research on whole genomes is still in an early stage. For example, the selection of 1 000 individuals is relatively small compared to the whole Swedish population. Thus, all common genetic variants are not yet included in the database. Furthermore, today\u2019s methods for genome sequencing are not completely perfect and are still being refined and developed. Progress is also made every year thanks to the increasing amount of data that is being produced. Sweden and SciLifeLab play a big part in this by enabling secure ways to cooperate around these large collections of data and share information.\n\n\u201dBoth research and health care are changing radically and knowledge about our genome will be a prerequisite in the future,\u201d Says Ulf Gyllensten. \u201dThis map is an early and important step in that development.\u201d\n\nThe resource is found at [swefreq.nbis.se](<https:\/\/swefreq.nbis.se>) and a description of the dataset is available at <http:\/\/biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2016\/10\/17\/081505>\n\nThis effort is part of SciLifeLabs initiative to support national projects in genomics, which has been enabled by the kind support from the [Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation](<https:\/\/www.wallenberg.com\/kaw\/en>).\n"},{"title":"Swefreq","date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","url":"\/news\/2016\/10\/19\/swefreq","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]}},{"title":"19","date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","url":"\/news\/2016\/10\/19","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]}},{"title":"[call: bioinformatics long-term support](<> \"permalink for call: bioinformatics long-term support\")","date":"2022-01-19T13:20:07+00:00","url":"\/news\/2016\/10\/06\/lts\/lts","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"    \n\nOctober 06, 2016\n\n[![](\/assets\/img\/logos\/icon-share-twitter.png)](<https:\/\/twitter.com\/share?url=https:\/\/nbis.se\/news\/2016\/10\/06\/lts\/> \"Tweet it!\")\n\n###  [Call: Bioinformatics Long-term Support](<> \"Permalink for Call: Bioinformatics Long-term Support\")\n\nOne of the national services offered by NBIS is [Bioinformatics Long-term support](<\/support\/longtermsupport.html>) (a.k.a. WABI) in next generation sequencing and related omics. We offer a senior bioinformatician to work in your project for up to 500 hours. The support is fully subsidized and free of charge, but extensive hands-on involvement is required by the applying research groups. Note that a part of this call will focus on early involvement in integrative omics projects, see below.\n\nProjects are selected based on their scientific quality, and the deadline for the next round of applications to be reviewed by the national evaluation committee is **FRIDAY OCTOBER 28th, 2016 (24:00)**.\n\nApplications are welcome for projects\n\n  * anywhere in Sweden\n  * any type of NGS application as well as other large-scale omics\n  * any bioinformatics skills\n\n\n\nThe decision on what projects get support in this call will be taken in December 2016. Typically, about 5-10 projects are granted support in each application round.\n\nIn addition to the regular projects, we also aim to grant support to an additional 1-3 projects with a clear focus on data integration, which can be subject to more extensive method development support. Beside scientific merits, these projects preferably combine multiple omics technologies and include methodological challenges of general interest.\n\nTo apply for support, you need to submit a small application about your project.\n\n### [Apply here](<\/support\/supportform\/index.php?form=longterm>)\n"},{"title":"Lts","date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","url":"\/news\/2016\/10\/06\/lts","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]}},{"title":"06","date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","url":"\/news\/2016\/10\/06","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]}},{"title":"[precog phenomics pipeline released](<> \"permalink for precog phenomics pipeline released\")","date":"2022-01-19T13:20:07+00:00","url":"\/news\/2016\/10\/05\/precog\/precog","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"    \n\nOctober 05, 2016\n\n[![](\/assets\/img\/logos\/icon-share-twitter.png)](<https:\/\/twitter.com\/share?url=https:\/\/nbis.se\/news\/2016\/10\/05\/precog\/> \"Tweet it!\")\n\n###  [PRECOG phenomics pipeline released](<> \"Permalink for PRECOG phenomics pipeline released\")\n\n![PRECOG](\/assets\/img\/logos\/precog.png)\n\nIn the functional genomics field, high-throughput phenotyping - phenomics - is critical to be able to systematically and efficiently map genotypes to phenotypes. To add to this effort, NBIS has contributed to the development of an automated analysis pipeline called PRECOG. PRECOG is a tool developed to automate visualization, quality control, analysis and exploration of complex and highly time-resolved microbial growth data. Most importantly, the tool allows standardised extraction of the fitness components growth lag, growth rate and growth efficiency, which will foster consistent analysis of phenotypic traits between different laboratories. PRECOG will thus promote simplicity, transparency and standardization in microbial growth phenomics, and provide a portal with the standalone software a web-tool and an API so that microbiology laboratories can easily upload, assess and visualize their growth data.\n\nRead more in the [BMC Bioinformatics paper](<https:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1186\/s12859-016-1134-2>).\n\nThe PRECOG portal can be found at [http:\/\/precog.lundberg.gu.se](<http:\/\/precog.lundberg.gu.se\\]>).\n"},{"title":"Precog","date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","url":"\/news\/2016\/10\/05\/precog","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]}},{"title":"05","date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","url":"\/news\/2016\/10\/05","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]}},{"title":"10","date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","url":"\/news\/2016\/10","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]}},{"title":"[welcome to nbis](<> \"permalink for welcome to nbis\")","date":"2022-01-19T13:20:07+00:00","url":"\/news\/2016\/04\/04\/welcome\/welcome","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"    \n\nApril 04, 2016\n\n[![](\/assets\/img\/logos\/icon-share-twitter.png)](<https:\/\/twitter.com\/share?url=https:\/\/nbis.se\/news\/2016\/04\/04\/welcome\/> \"Tweet it!\")\n\n###  [Welcome to NBIS](<> \"Permalink for Welcome to NBIS\")\n\nWelcome to NBIS \u2013 National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden \u2013 the successor of BILS which starts now in April 2016.

We offer software development as a support service, but also develop tools in European and Nordic collaborations. For a non-exhaustive list of tools developed\/maintained by NBIS staff, see our [tools page](<\/infrastructure\/tools>).\n\n## Data management\n\nNBIS can assist Swedish scientists in various data management issues, such as writing data management plans, publishing of datasets in repositories, guidance on how to work with sensitive human data, etc. For more information please see our [Data management page](<\/infrastructure\/data-management>).\n\n## Proteomics data storage and processing\n\nNBIS provides a data handling pipeline for proteomics laboratories that converts raw mass spectrometry data into standard formats and provides secure storage at the national storage. Data can be further shared between different users and processed through the [Proteios Software Environment](<http:\/\/www.proteios.org>) interface, which also provides protein identification and quantification workflows. Open access to published research data is an important aim of the national infrastructure, and the platform provides users with facilitated publication of raw and processed data at [ProteomeXchange](<http:\/\/www.proteomexchange.org\/>) through the [PRIDE partner repository](<http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/pride\/archive\/>). See also the [technical description](<https:\/\/projects.bils.se\/projects\/bils-proteomics-data-storage-documentation\/wiki>).\n\nNBIS also drives a project that aims to serve users with high-throughput mass spectrometry shotgun proteomics data processing. The framework for this is currently [Galaxy](<http:\/\/usegalaxy.org>), and it is our intention to deliver the platform to individual groups or core facilities. Technically the platform will be running on a cloud instance owned by the respective user, but it will also be possible to install on one\u2019s own hardware. The platform is highly flexible and can access files at the national file storage or local files provided by the users.\n"},{"title":"Refactoring_hacks","date":"2022-01-20T14:06:05+00:00","url":"\/events\/refactoring_hacks","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"media":["onebyte_dict.json","Opcodes.txt","reify.js","twobyte_dict.json","x86reference.xml"]},{"title":"Refactoring_hacks","date":"2022-01-20T14:06:04+00:00","url":"\/events\/jslinux-deobfuscated\/refactoring_hacks","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"media":["onebyte_dict.json","Opcodes.txt","reify.js","twobyte_dict.json","x86reference.xml"]},{"title":"Jslinux-deobfuscated","date":"2022-01-20T14:06:04+00:00","url":"\/events\/jslinux-deobfuscated","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"media":["clipboard.js","CMOS.js","cpux86-ta.js","cpux86-ta.original.js","index.html","jslinux.js","KBD.js","linuxstart-20110820.tar.gz","PCEmulator.js","PIC.js","PIT.js","Serial.js","term.js"],"content":"De-obfuscated JSLinux\n=========================================================\n\nThis repo corresponds to a very old version of jslinux, Mr. Bellard \ncurrently uses an emscripten converted emulator for the current jslinux.\n\nThere are better emulator codebases out there for pedagogical use!\n\nI highly recommend checking out another open-source x86 emulation\nproject that includes vga support, \"v86\" ([demo][6] \/ [source][7]).\nThere's yet another open-source 386-style emulator in javascript\ncalled [jslm32][3].\n\nFor a simpler RISC architecture, take a look at the linux on\n[jor1k][5] emulator project.\n\nFinally, the [Angel][8] emulator ([source][9]) shows off the elegant\nopen-ISA 64bit [RISC-V][10] architecture that is being brought to\nsilicon by the [lowrisc][11] team.  This is by far the cleanest\narchitecture for studying general low-level hardware and operating\nsystem implementation details.\n\n### History\nI wanted to understand how the amazing [JsLinux][1] worked, so in a\nfit of mania I hand de-obfuscated the codebase while studying it over\na few days' time.  In the off-chance someone else might be interested\nin this code as a basis for further weird in-browser x86 hacking I\nposted this redacted version of the code here, with permission of\nMr. Bellard.\n\n### Status\n\nThe current codebase should run on most modern versions of Chrome,\nSafari, and Firefox.  If you're running it locally, you will need to\nload it via a local server to allow the XHR requests to load the\nbinaries.\n\njslinux-deobfuscated is still a dense, messy code base from any\npedagogic point of view.  However for those interested in\nMr. Bellard's code, this version is nowhere near so incomprehensible\nas the original.  Nearly all of the global variables and function\nnames have been named somewhat sensibly.  Many pointers to references\nhave been added to the source.\n\nThe core opcode execution loop has been commented to indicate what\ninstruction the opcode refers to.\n\n### Unresolved\n\nOne mystery is, why does CPUID(1) return 8 << 8 in EBX? EBX[15:8] is\nnow used to indicate CLFLUSH line size, but that field must have been\nused for something else in the past.\n\nThe CALL\/RET\/INT\/IRET routines are still quite confused and haven't\nyet been rewritten.

The quest for finding answers to complex biological problems has increased the demand for computational training and skills. The vast amount of data brings with itself new challenges and new opportunities. Therefore, in the field of computational biology, it is now more important than ever to work towards solutions together. This can only be achieved by developing communities that serve as a platform to share knowledge and foster collaborations. Empowering synergy of interdisciplinary teams is an important step to achieve our common goal of developing the world through science and technology.\n\nThe [International Society for Computational Biology](<http:\/\/www.iscb.org\/>) (ISCB) and its [Student Council](<http:\/\/www.iscbsc.org\/>) (SC) are the global organizations that work towards building the community of a next generation of researchers in the field of computational biology. The Student Council serves as a leading platform to develop and support student communities across the globe. Its dedicated members work voluntarily and passionately devoting their time towards community development and education outreach 1. One of the SC\u2019s major initiatives is a concept of [Regional Student Group](<http:\/\/rsg.iscbsc.org\/>) (RSG) introduced in 2006 2.\n\nBuilding communities is a crucial step towards cross-disciplinary research 3. It provides exposure to training resources that can help us, the future generation of scientists, realise our potential for academia and industry. An equally important task is to spread the knowledge and encourage the public to learn about the rapidly developing fields of bioinformatics and computational biology. More efforts towards education outreach and public engagement are required in both areas. With such aims in mind, we decided to launch Sweden\u2019s computational biology student organisation known as the [**R** egional **S** tudent **G** roup- **Sweden**](<http:\/\/rsg-sweden.iscbsc.org\/>).\n\n## RSG-Sweden\n\nThe idea is to encourage more students and early-career researchers to get interested in the fascinating intersection of computer science and biology, while also helping them get past their fear of learning programming. Our mission is motivated by that of our parent organisations, with an aim towards students and researchers across Sweden. Our goals include making the computational biology community welcoming and diverse, promoting research, providing educational and training resources, sharing information about career opportunities, and encouraging participation at international conferences.\n\nThe initiative has received a great response and support from students, other RSGs, people at the ISCB, and researchers at prestigious universities - that our mission to expand the computational biology community of Sweden is not only valuable but also important. Therefore, with our [concept of branches](<http:\/\/rsg-sweden.iscbsc.org\/#rsg-sweden-branches>), we plan to take RSG-Sweden to different locations across Sweden.\n\n<img src='assets\/img\/2019-02-14_rsgsweden_map.png' height='500px' alt='Map showing RSG-Sweden branches' \/>\n\n_Since the launch in February 2018, RSG-Sweden has established four branches with the Lund branch being the first and the Gothenburg branch being the latest._\n\nSetting up a branch is a great opportunity for students and researchers to increase visibility of their, for example, research group, computational biology facility, bioinformatics centre as well as institution in a wider scientific community. Together with our branches, we have made progress in meeting our objectives by organizing events such as seminars, journal clubs, online networking hours, and career events. In the future, we plan to bring new ideas such as organising hackathons, collaboration with industries across Sweden and with other RSGs across Europe. Sweden rushes in second place in the recently commenced race of RSGs amongst the Nordic countries. Up until now, [RSG-Denmark](<http:\/\/www.cbiovikings.org\/>) was the only Nordic bioinformatics student organisation, founded in 2015. We hope our shared initiative will encourage our neighbouring countries to build a computational biology community for current and future researchers.\n\n### Authors\n\n  * Nazeefa Fatima, Uppsala University, Sweden (corresponding author; [nazeefa@iscb.org](<mailto:nazeefa@iscb.org>))\n  * Martin Ryde\u0301n, BMC, Faculty of Medicine, Lund University, Sweden\n  * Cathrine Bergh, Science for Life Laboratory and KTH, Stockholm, Sweden\n\n\n\n### References\n\n  1.

Nylander\n\n**... get the top hits from BLAST outfmt 6?**\n\n<img src='assets\/img\/awkblast.png' width='100%' alt='awkblast' \/>\n\nFinding simple solutions for challenging problems always gives me a sense of joy and sometimes even relief: no need to spend a lot of time when you can solve it quickly, and then preferably with minimum code.\n\nArguably one of the most elegant solutions I\u2019ve come across, is how to use the [AWK](<https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/AWK>) programming language for extracting the top hits from the output of a blast search:\n    \n    \n    awk '!x[$1]++'\n    \n\nThis expression might require some background and further explanations.\n\n## Background\n\nIf you work long enough in bioinformatics, sooner or later you will be faced with the need of \u201c[running blast locally](<https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/guide\/howto\/run-blast-local\/>)\u201d (or \u201crun a stand-alone blast\u201d). This simply mean that instead of doing your similarity search by uploading your query sequence to a web page (e.g. [NBCI\u2019s BLAST portal](<https:\/\/blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Blast.cgi>)), you run your search algorithm locally on your own computer and using your own data base.\n\nThe main benefit from running searches locally is that you can taylor your data base to your needs, and also manipulate the output so it fits exactly in down stream computational work flows.\n\nDealing with the latter is perhaps also where you face the first obstacle. Instead of having the results packaged and displayed nicely in the web browser, you have to read (parse) potentially very large files and manipulate the output.\n\nIf we take the output from a blast search as our example, the format might look something like this:\n    \n    \n    Apa\tPBF38905.1\t92.115\t279\t22\t0\t2\t838\t48\t326\t0.0\t518\n    Apa\tPBF45636.1\t92.115\t279\t22\t0\t2\t838\t48\t326\t0.0\t518\n    Apa\tPBG14713.1\t92.115\t279\t22\t0\t2\t838\t48\t326\t0.0\t518\n    [...]\n    Bpa\tPDG94623.1\t89.785\t186\t19\t0\t558\t1\t73\t258\t1.78e-115\t325\n    Bpa\tPDL27043.1\t89.247\t186\t20\t0\t558\t1\t73\t258\t2.75e-115\t325\n    Bpa\tPDL27950.1\t89.247\t186\t20\t0\t558\t1\t73\t258\t2.75e-115\t325\n    [...]\n    Cpa\tPIS68069.1\t51.145\t131\t62\t2\t399\t10\t1\t130\t1.77e-43\t142\n    Cpa\tPIS68081.1\t46.617\t133\t67\t3\t390\t1\t12\t143\t1.31e-37\t127\n    Cpa\tPCF98276.1\t48.819\t127\t58\t3\t375\t1\t24\t145\t1.85e-34\t118\n    [...]\n    \n\nThis is \u201cformat 6\u201d in blast, with tab separated columns in the default order `'qaccver saccver pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore'`. Please see the [BLAST+ Manual](<https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK279684\/>) for further information.\n\nFor each query (`Apa`, `Bpa`, `Cpa` in the example above), the best hits are given as the first line for each query, and then listed in descending order. Keeping a number of hits in the output will inform us about the variation around the best hit, and can be very useful. But if we were interested in extracting only the top hit per query (ignoring the rest), how can we do that?\n\nHere is where the example using AWK can help. The program `awk` (listening to commands written in the language AWK) is probably _the_ work horse when it comes to reading structured data and is ideal for this particular problem.\n\nA break down of the code shows that the script (`!x[$1]++`) consists of a single statement:\n\n_\u201cIf we can not add to the value for an existing index (the index being the string in the first column), then print the line\u201d_\n\nThe central part is utilizing a data structure called an associative array (or dictionary\/hash), which is the `x[]` in the script (the name `x` is arbitrarily chosen). This array is a list of associated values given as key-value pairs. If you know the key (or index), you can very quickly get the value. One feature of the array is that the keys are strings, and need to be unique, whereas the values can be the same, or different for different keys. If we already have a value, say `10`, for a key `k`, we can increment that value by one by using the `++` operator as such: `x[k]++`. Now the value for `k` is `11`.\n\nAnother great feature is that the array can grow easily. If we try to increment a value for a key (`m`) that is not presently in the array, by using `x[m]++`, the key is created and then incremented. The argument `!` is a negation, so when we write `!x[$1]++`, we mean _\u201cif we cannot add to the value for an existing key\u201d_.\n\nThere are a number of built-in variables in `awk`, and perhaps most useful are the column numbers `$1`, `$2`, etc (until the last column `$NF`). For our problem, we are especially interested in what we have in column 1 (`$1`), since this is where we see the identity of the query.\n\nThe actual reading and printing is taken care of by `awk` itself. The program reads from standard in and prints to standard out by default, so we don\u2019t have to add code in order to read or print the lines from our input.\n\nSo finally, in other words, _\u201cread the input from standard in line by line, and if we haven\u2019t seen the string in column one before, print the line to standard out, otherwise not\u201d._\n\nAnd this is exactly what we want to achieve: we only want to print the line with the first occurrence of `Apa` in the first column, since that is the top hit!\n\nMore on column data and `awk` later\u2026\n\n`:wq`\n\n## Complete BLAST+ example\n\n  1. Get the software. Here we will use [BLAST+](<https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK279671\/>) as an example. On a Debian-based Linux system, installation is as easy as\n    \n         sudo apt install ncbi-blast+\n    \n\n  2. Get some data (fasta files `db.fas`, 252K, 500 seqs, `query.fas`, 8K, 6 seqs)\n    \n         wget https:\/\/gist.github.com\/nylander\/a044690c63494674d9b4fb30ba27762d\/raw\/db.fas\n     wget https:\/\/gist.github.com\/nylander\/a044690c63494674d9b4fb30ba27762d\/raw\/query.fas\n    \n\n  3. Format the database\n    \n         makeblastdb -in db.fas -dbtype prot -parse_seqids\n    \n\n  4. Run a local blast search, saving output as \u201cformat 6\u201d (tab separated, no headers). The blast suite of software allows you to decide the output fields. It might be time well spent to read up on how this is done so you can save your strength when parsing the output. See `blastx -help` and the [Manual, Table C4](<https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK279684\/>) for description of options.\n    \n         blastx -query query.fas -db db.fas -out blast.out \\\n        -outfmt \"6 qseqid sacc stitle evalue bitscore pident qseq sseq\" \\\n        -max_target_seqs 10 \\\n        -query_gencode 11 \\\n        -num_threads 4\n    \n\n  5.

Choose one, young bioinformatician.**\n\nIn the canonical phrasing you could only pick two out of three, but obviously you can\u2019t pick \u201con budget\u201d if you\u2019re not in the position to hire people, unless there is a throw-money-at-the-problem solution like hardware or outsourcing. So you\u2019re not a boss, and this saying may need modification even further. Often when doing scientific development you are pressed to deliver faster, maybe simply by fear of being scooped. Not to mention the possibility to see your project become obsolete when it comes out. Science moves fast and thus your work moves to the garbage bin fast too.\n\nMy first moves in software were heavily influenced by reading too much [Hacker News](<https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com>). Having a lot of fun but neither CS degree nor lots of experience in programming meant I had to learn on the spot. After the first phase of very dirty code, came other phases, which included the obvious too-many-abstractions phase, unit testing volatile components phase, and the phase were I used frameworks too heavy for the job. At least I managed to dodge the rewrite everything in $LANGUAGE phase. Having had those, I feel quite well about my process as it evolved. But there is always quicker and dirtier on the one hand, and cleaner, more scalable, and more secure on the other. What to do?\n\nOf course it all depends on the job you are to do. A good rule of thumb is the adage \u201cmake it work, make it correct, make it fast\u201d. But I do not think this always holds true. For example, in case you are creating a tool (i.e making it work or correct), and you _need_ to test on large datasets, speed will be extremely beneficial to your development process. So you\u2019d better go and optimize file access, disks, networks and algorithms. Then again, when developing some internal web resource, program performance is probably not even worth looking at before you move on to the next project, and development speed will be king. As a somewhat extreme example, a respected colleague once wondered if I wouldn\u2019t deliver a web resource faster if I skipped developing the backend and let the javascript talk to the database directly. We didn\u2019t end up pursuing this, but I have to mention that my colleague isn\u2019t some beginner with a knack for quick and dirty code, but one of the fastest working bioinformatics developers I have seen. Had the suggestion come at the start of the project, I would have considered it a great way to get a resource up. I took notes for next project, my face still pale with fear of this practice and how many security holes we would introduce.\n\nBut you can dig into frameworks too much too, especially if you\u2019re not used to them. Overengineering is a creeping disease. I can start with a quick protoype, and maybe add some [Django](<https:\/\/djangoproject.com>), and suddenly I get the urge to create a containerized infrastructure for an [Nginx](<https:\/\/nginx.org>) proxy, Django API, some exotic DB and the Javascript framework-of-the-month, all unit, regression and integration tested on a CI platform connected to github. Because we all want to be AmaGoogBookFlix. (Do consider the options, they are valuable possibilities and you may need them.) My way to combat overengineering tendencies is to look at the to-do list and think which things I can postpone to a future version. It\u2019s hardly perfect and still feels like a battle.\n\nThe technology stack above was of course an obvious example, but there are frameworks that have value and slow you down at the same time. I feel I am well versed in tool development for and a fan of the [Galaxy](<https:\/\/galaxyproject.github.io\/>) project for instance, but I can\u2019t help but thinking now and then that I would have analysis pipelines and tools available much faster when deploying them in R, bash or python (especially since I dislike editing XML). There is a price to pay for flexible, shareable tools that install problem free. But maybe a solution where you can have the cake and eat it pops up one day.\n\nUntil I find that, nothing is for free. To use a terrible metaphor, technical debt can be cheap as project-inflation eats it up. But anything long-lived, collaborative or critical enough should probably marinate in your development machine longer. Choose wisely.\n"},{"title":"Blog","date":"2022-01-19T13:20:07+00:00","url":"\/blog","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"    \n\n# Blog\n\n_Welcome to NBIS blog.

Not be subject to decisions based solely on an automated processing of data (i.e. without human intervention) without being able to having your views taken into consideration.\n\n  2. Request at reasonable intervals and without excessive delay or expense, information about the personal data processed about you and the data processed.\n\n  3. Request information to understand data processing activities when the results of these activities are applied to you (e.g. why is information collected, how do you object etc.).\n\n  4. Request rectification of your personal data. You are also entitled to request limitation of processing your personal until rectified.\n\n  5. Object to the processing of your personal data.\n\n  6.

For repeated requests we may charge an administrative fee, but it must not be so high that it deters valid requests. As a last resort may also turn down abusive requests.\n\nSince our host Uppsala University is a government entity you are also entitled to have your request tried in administrative court.\n\nIf you want to exercise these rights then please contact the Data Protection Officer (see How to contact us).\n\n## How to contact us\n\nLegally NBIS is part of the Uppsala University and therefore uses Uppsala University\u2019s legal personality.\n\nJacob H\u00e5kansson, Data Protection Officer at Uppsala University Email: dataskyddsombud@uu.se\n"},{"title":"Nbis organization","date":"2022-01-19T13:20:07+00:00","url":"\/about\/organization","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"    \n\n# NBIS Organization\n\n## NBIS Board\n\nChairman: Ulf Gyllensten, Uppsala University\n\nLeif Andersson, Uppsala University  \nAnna Arnqvist, Ume\u00e5 University  \nLaura Elo, University of Turku  \nEivind Hovig, University of Oslo  \nTanja Slotte, Stockholm University  \nTherese S\u00f8rlie, Oslo University Hospital  \nHelena Westerdahl, Lund University\n\n## NBIS Scientific Advisory Board\n\nAmos Bairoch, Switzerland  \nJaap Heringa, the Netherlands  \nMichal Linial, Israel  \nKathryn Lilley, United Kingdom  \nLars Malmstr\u00f6m, Switzerland  \nTorben Falck \u00d8rntoft, Denmark\n\n## NBIS Reference Group\n\nThe NBIS Reference group is currently being appointed based on nominations from all NBIS partners.\n"},{"title":"Nbis documents","date":"2022-01-19T13:20:07+00:00","url":"\/about\/doc","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"    \n\n# NBIS Documents\n\n## [NBIS Strategic Plan 2021 \u2013 2025](<\/assets\/doc\/NBIS Strategic Plan 2021--2025.pdf>)\n\n## [NBIS Annual report 2020](<\/assets\/doc\/NBIS Annual Report 2020.pdf>)\n\n## Logotypes\n\n[Orange with text](<\/assets\/img\/logos\/nbislogo-orange-txt.svg>)  \n[Orange w\/o text](<\/assets\/img\/logos\/nbislogo-orange.svg>)  \n[Green w\/o text](<\/assets\/img\/logos\/nbislogo-green.svg>)  \n[Green with text](<\/assets\/img\/logos\/nbislogo-green-txt.svg>)  \n[Blue with text](<\/assets\/img\/logos\/nbislogo-blue-txt.svg>)\n\n## Forms\n\n[Support order form for academics](<\/assets\/doc\/nbis-form-academics-ver10.pdf>)\n\n[Support order form for companies](<\/assets\/doc\/nbis-form-companies-ver9.pdf>)\n\n[Long-term support application form](<\/assets\/doc\/bioinformaticslongterm_applicationform.doc>)\n\n[Partner project agreement form](<\/assets\/doc\/nbis-form-pp-ver6.pdf>)\n\n## User Agreements\n\n[NBIS Support User Agreement](<\/assets\/doc\/nbis-support-useragreement.pdf>)\n\n## Minutes from Board Meetings\n\n[1 2018](<\/assets\/doc\/nbis-steering-group-2018-1.pdf>)  \n[2 2018](<\/assets\/doc\/nbis-steering-group-2018-2.pdf>)  \n[3 2018](<\/assets\/doc\/nbis-steering-group-2018-3.pdf>)\n\n[1 2019](<\/assets\/doc\/nbis-steering-group-2019-1.pdf>)  \n[2 2019](<\/assets\/doc\/nbis-steering-group-2019-2.pdf>)\n\n[1 2020](<\/assets\/doc\/nbis-steering-group-2020-1.pdf>)  \n[2 2020](<\/assets\/doc\/nbis-steering-group-2020-2.pdf>)  \n[3 2020](<\/assets\/doc\/nbis-steering-group-2020-3.pdf>)\n\n[1 2021](<\/assets\/doc\/nbis-steering-group-2021-1.pdf>)\n"},{"title":"Contact information","date":"2022-01-19T13:20:07+00:00","url":"\/about\/contact","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"    \n\n# Contact Information\n\n## Email\n\n[info@nbis.se](<mailto:info@nbis.se>)\n\n## Postal Address\n\nNBIS  \nUppsala University  \nSciLifeLab  \nICM \u2013 Department of Cell and Molecular Biology  \nBox 596  \nS-751 24 Uppsala, SWEDEN\n"},{"title":"About nbis","date":"2022-01-19T13:20:07+00:00","url":"\/about","taxonomy":{"categories":[],"tags":[]},"content":"    \n\n# About NBIS\n\nNBIS (National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden) is a distributed national research infrastructure supported by the [Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsr\u00e5det)](<http:\/\/www.vr.se>), [Science for Life Laboratory](<https:\/\/www.scilifelab.se>), all major Swedish universities and the [Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation](<https:\/\/www.wallenberg.com\/kaw\/en>), providing state-of-the-art bioinformatics to the Swedish life science researchers community.
